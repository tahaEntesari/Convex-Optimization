	The Simulation results are provided here. Oddly enough, non of the questions would reach a solution with certainty and are extremely dependent on the choice of random matrices that are generated at first, thus, the code is written in such a way to continue generating random matrices until a case is reached in which an answer is achieved for that problem. After reaching a solution, the said matrices are saved for future uses. 
	\section*{Problem 5}
	The CVX code for part a is simple but due to the random generation of matrices that is mentioned above, the result of the executed code would mostly be that the \textit{status} is \textit{infeasible} and the \textit{optimal value} is $ +\infty $. An instance of good matrices is saved and appended and available in the zip file.\\
	The code for part b is implemented in 2 ways; One is the solution provided by the textbook and the other is the less simplified one that I myself have derived. For the matrix set that is generated in part \textit{a}, both these methods, as expected, result in the same optimal value, and the mentioned optimal value is less than the one in part \textit{a} which suggests that there is a gap between the primal and the original problem. With the mentioned matrix, the result of part \textit{a} would be $ -0.46 $ whereas the optimal value achieved by part \textit{b} is $ -2.36 $.\\
	The question has asked to generate the matrices for different \textit{n} and compare the consumed \textit{cpu time} but the process of finding matrices that would result in solvable problems is very  time consuming and this process could not be completed.
	\section*{Problem 6}
	The dual problem of the relative entropy problem is implemented in this section. The problem in this problem is that almost always the \textit{status} would be \textit{unbounded} and the \textit{optimal value} would be $ +\infty $. Following the same procedure as the previous section, a set of good matrices are saved and are appended and available in the zip file. For the mentioned set of matrices the optimal value is $ -0.97442 $.
